---# Introduction
Level and volatility of overnight policy, administered, and wholesale money market rates move closely together but vary dramatically  with external shocks to these markets and different central bank policy regimes.  Goal: to find the willingness of the US central bank  to offset volatility to manage the Federal Funds rates within its target range. in different Federal Reserve policy regimes.

The volume of trade in interbank markets even more volatile than rates

Hypotheses 1 Volatility: the distributions of secured rates TGCR, BGCR, SOFR,similar to the unsecured rates EFFR and OBFR, changes with FOMC policy
Hypotheses 2 Dispersion of rates but quick reversion to changes in the federal funds rate (FFR)
Hypothesis 3 Fed's preference for offsetting volatility in the Federal Funds market to manage the FFR within its range
Hypothesis 4: The demand for each instrument, price versus volume reveals,large changes in demand but relatively stable rates
Hypothesis 5 The volatility response of overnight rates to Fed interventions is greater:  the lower reserves, the magnitude of the shock of the monetary policy interventions, the type of  change in policy intervention: the Fed Funds targets, or bounds of the channel for the EFFR rate or the administered rates, the IOR and ONRRP. A puzzle: price stable, demand fluctuates? 
  
Motivation for this work:
- An efficient ample reserves regime minimizes frequency of operations, volatility of interest rates, and balance sheet costs (Schuhlhofer)
-  Bertolini, Bertola, Prati () and Gara () observe the effect of Fed interventions on the volatility in interbank rates

## Rates
The unsecured daily median effective Federal Funds rate (EFFR) is... The secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) is a broad measure of the general cost of financing Treasury securities for a broad range of repurchase market participants. SOFR is a measure of the the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities. 

The level of rates  and changes in volatility as measured by the standard deviation is more evident in the latter three years of the sample, 2020, 2021, and 2022 than in the earlier years 2016 and 2017 Table \ref{table:FOMCdailyratestats} ) A second feature of the sample is changes in the volume of transactions, is greater than changes in rates, both in median volumes and and their volatility. Here volatility  as measured by the annual standard deviation of the series.

Annual changes in median rates in the early years of the sample, 2016-2019 (Table \ref{table:FOMCdailyratestats}), are not as volatile as the later years 2020-2022. Annual changes in EFFR rates changed some 70 to 87 bp (basis points) in 2017 and 2018, 46 to 52 basis points in 2019. The most volatile changes in the later years are the fall in the EFFR in 2020 of 228 bp and the 158 basis point increase in 2022.								
This difference in rate volatility is borne out by the changes in the standard deviation of the EFFR,3.56				to 14.94 bp in the earlier years, but 24.07 bp in 2020, -55.07 in 2021, and 139.14 in 2022

## Times series behavior of rates within different FOMC policy regimes
We can examine a more detailed look at the time series properties of reference rates and transactions by dividing the sample in subsets that reflect five distinct policy regimes in the data:
1. normalcy              3/4/2016-7/31/2019     % 4  859
2. mid cycle adjustment  8/1/2019-10/31/2019 737660  %860 - 923
3. covid                 11/1/2019-3/16/2020   %924  1032
4. Zero lower bound (zlb) 3/17/2020-3/16/2022     %1032-1516
5. Taming inflation     03/17/2022-12/29/2022 %1517-1741


ThseE FOMC rates changes, monetary regimes, and events (Table \ref{table:FOMCratechanges}) occurred during the six year period of our sample 2016-2022.

## Daily volumes of transactions in the interbank market
 The times series behavior of the dollar volume  in overnight rate securities is similar to that of the rates, high levels and volatility in 2020-2022, the tendency to cluster around volumes of the unsecured rates, EFFR and OBFR (Table ~\ref{table:FOMCdailyvolumestats}).
#Figure \ref{fig:volumesample1}
#(Figure \ref{fig:stackedmedvol}).

The same can be said for the annual changes in volumes traded, small changes in 2016-1019, large changes in 2020-2022. Volumes in EFFR traded  increased by $\$$407 billion in 2020, then dropped off $\$$216 billion in 2021, and fell a further $\$$164 billion in 2022. Traded volumes are volatile during these years, the standard deviation increasing $\$$197,19 in 2020, falling $\$$87.03 billion in 2021, and dropping another $\$$170 billion in 2022.	

During the earlier years 2016 and 2017,  BGCR volume exceeds TGCR volume until both rates achieve their maximum,  then the reverse as rates and volumes of transactions decline.  During the period of the zero lower bound, there is little trading in any of the overnight rate products. 
The volume of Effective Federal Funds rate (EFFR) transactions rose 407 in 2020 and fell 216 in 2021 and 164 in 2022 \ref{table:FOMCdailyvolumestats}).
Then TCGR and BGCR volumes surge as the FOMC raises the Federal Funds rate in 2022.
(Figure \ref{fig:stackedmedvolumes}). mean, medias, and standard deviations daily volumes ($\$$ billions) characterize their distribution (Table \ref{table:FOMCdailyvolumestats}).
 
The increases in SOFR volumes dwarf the EFFR  increased 068  %268 in 2019 and 878 in 2022. SOFR volumes fell 682 in 2020 and 292 in 2021. Daily SOFR trading volumes, $\$1.1$ trillion
dwarf the Federal funds market, $\$62.5$ billion.
(2020? Gibbs CME webinar on repo).


#older: integrate with above
For the sample period 2016 through 2022, median transactions in unsecured rates were $\$$210 billion (EFFR), $\$$312 billion (OBFR). Volumes in secured rights were much higher $\$$359 (TGCR), $\$$637 (BGCR). It's notable how lower were the volume of transactions in the unsecured rates, the EFFR and OBFR. Trade in SOFR was a small $\$$103 billion where volatility was also the highest, $\$$405 billion. The standard deviations for EFFR, OBFR and  BGCR were around $\$$250 billion,  TGCR a lower $\$$179 billion. The  dollar volume of transactions in the EFFR and SOFR exhibit more volatility than their rates (Table \ref{table:FOMCdailyvolumestats}). 

The standard deviation of the volume of EFFR transactions increased 108 $\$62.5$ billion in 2019 and 197 $\$62.5$ billion in 2020 but fell 170$\$62.5$billion in 2022. SOFR 234 $\$62.5$ billion in 2019 and 168$\$62.5$ billion in 2022 but fell 258 $\$62.5$ billion in 2021.

The largest increases in volatility in EFFR occurred in 2019, 108  billion and 197  billion in 2020.
The standard deviation of EFFR fell 38 billion in 2017, 87 billion in 2021, and 170 billion in 2022. Volatility in SOFR fell in  
2017, 9  billion , and 258 billion in 2021.  Major increases occurred in  2019, 234  billion, and  2022,  168	 billion.

## Clustering, Other measures of volatility
# Add dispersion?
Other measures of volatility %(Figure \ref{fig:volmeasures})
Intraday volatility, standard deviation of EFFR and deviations of the effective federal funds from the target rate
1) simple standard deviation
2) log percent change
\begin{equation*}
vol_1= log(r_{t+1})- log(r_t) 
\end{equation*}
3) standard deviation of log percent change 
$vol_2=standard deviation of vol_1$
4) standard  deviation of log percent change with trailing window of 244 days?   
$vol_3= movstd(vol_2,244) $
%4) deviations of the effective federal funds from the target rate? 
Three measures of rate volatility: percent change, log percent change, rolling standard deviation

Volatility clustering, one of the most important stylized facts in financial markets, refers to the observation that large changes in price tend to be followed by large changes and small changes tend to be followed by small changes. Evidence of clustering of annual volatility across reference rates. Evidence of clusters within these periods (\ref{fig:volmeasures}).  High volatility follows periods of high volatility.Low volatility follows periods of low volatility. 
 From 2017 to 2018, volatility as measured by the annual standard deviation  increased only 8.18 bp, increasing to 29.59 from 21.41 bp  (\ref{table:FOMCratessd}) ).  From 2018 to 2019, volatility of the EFFR fell 3.56 basis points.

## Weekly rates and reserves}
#(Hypothesis 1 continued 
With weekly data on reserves, I explore the behavior of reference rates and transactions in these instruments joint with the time series characteristics of reserves. Since daily reserve data are available only to Federal Reserve staff, NYFed staff recommended this analysis use  the weekly series of reserves Reserve Balances with Federal Reserve Banks: Week Average (WRESBAL) $\$S$ billions normalized by deposits of commercial banks (DPSACBW027SBOG) $\$S$ billions to control for the growth of the banking industry. Both weekly series ending on Wednesday.

DISCUSS NUMBERS OF NORMALIZED RESERVES
Total reserves in the U. S. banking system now exceed  $\$$3.081237 trillion (Totresns). At the beginning of 2009, reserves were $\$$800 billion, compared to approximately $\$$10 billion pre-crisis. Reserves continued to increase until late 2014. Fed’s quantitative easing programs raised reserves to  a peak of $\$$2.8 trillion in September 2014.  Peak reserves peaked $\$$4.275 at then end of 2021 In November 2022, From late 2017, when the Federal Open Market Committee began implementing its policy of “balance sheet normalization” aggregate reserves began to decline, reaching a low of $\$$1.4 trillion in early September 2019 (Table \ref{table:weeklyreserves}, Figure \ref{fig:weeklyreserves}). 

The sample shows evidence that rates are higher when reserves are low, and the converse when reserves are high or 'ample'. During 2016 and 2017 reserves were $\$$180 to $\$$200 million reaching a low of $\$$160 million on 1/4/2017 (Table ~\ref{table:statsweeklyratesannual}).
During the initial years of the sample from 3/02/2016 until. reserves were around $\$$200 million until 9/28/2016 when reserves fell to $\$$180 million. Then returned to $\$$200 million on 2/15/2017 until  6/24/2018 .
From 7/28/2017 to 6/24/2018, volume weighted median overnight money market rates are higher and normalized reserves are low,  0.19 or $\$$190 million  the week of 7/26/2017 (Figure \ref{figure:vmrates}). All rates reach a maximum at the end of June or first week of July 2018. The EFFR and OBFR reach their maximum value 179.56  and 387.74 basis points respectively during the week 6/24/2018.  The money market rates TGCR, BGCR, and SOFR reach their maxima the following  week 7/1/2018,  Reserves per deposits fell to 0.16 or $\$$160 million on 6/27/2018. All rates then decline, reaching their lowest level 4/5/2020 just as reserves begin to increase to 0.18 or or $\$$180 million . The EFFR reaches a low of 1.74 basis points. Reserves increase from  4/5/2020 to 9/15/2021, 0.24 or $\$$240 million then begin to decline.  From 3/13/2022 to the present, all rates rise steeply with the successive increases in the Fed policy rate response to inflation. The EFFR rises on 3/13/2022 from 1,74 to	27.36 basis points. Reserves decline slightly to 0.17 or $\$$170 million at the end of the sample 12/29/2022 (revise data)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
