\section{Introduction}
Level and volatility of overnight policy, administered, and wholesale money market rates move closely together but vary dramatically  with external shocks to these markets and different central bank policy regimes.  Goal: to find the willingness of the US central bank  to offset volatility to manage the Federal Funds rates within its target range. in different Federal Reserve policy regimes.

The volume of trade in interbank markets even more volatile than rates


Hypotheses 1 Volatility: the distributions of secured rates TGCR, BGCR, SOFR,similar to the unsecured rates EFFR and OBFR, changes with FOMC policy
Hypotheses 2 Dispersion of rates but quick reversion to changes in the federal funds rate (FFR)
Hypothesis 3 Fed's preference for offsetting volatility in the Federal Funds market to manage the FFR within its range
Hypothesis 4: The demand for each instrument, price versus volume reveals,large changes in demand but relatively stable rates
Hypothesis 5 The volatility response of overnight rates to Fed interventions is greater:  the lower reserves, the magnitude of the shock of the monetary policy interventions, the type of  change in policy intervention: the Fed Funds targets, or bounds of the channel for the EFFR rate or the administered rates, the IOR and ONRRP. A puzzle: price stable, demand fluctuates? 

Motivation for this work:
- An efficient ample reserves regime minimizes frequency of operations, volatility of interest rates, and balance sheet costs (Schuhlhofer)
-  Bertolini, Bertola, Prati () and Gara () observe the effect of Fed interventions on the volatility in interbank rates

The  effectiveness of monetary policy to transmit the desired stance of monetary policy to financial markets and the real economy economy depends on efficient transmission of rate changes to other short rates in wholesale and consumer funding market.This paper examines the dispersion and volatility of short term rates. 


To manage the build up in liquidity in reserves, the Fed initiated the policy regime of ample reserves in order to  maintain/manage the Fed Funds rate within its target range. It's administrative rates comprise a floor system where  interest on reserves (IOR) paid on bank reserves with the Fed are the ceiling and the overnight reverse repurchase rate (ONRRP rate) is the  floor. The Fed or FOMC also temporarily intervenes in repurchase (repo) and reverse repo to offset high frequency liquidity shocks to keep federal funds rate close to target.

The federal funds rate is the Fed's policy rate. The effective federal funds rate (EFFR) tracks transactions in the federal funds market. The overnight  bank funding rate (OBFR), similar to the EFFR, a broad measure of U.S. dollar funding costs for U.S. based banks. The secured overnight funding rate (SOFR) captures transactions in  overnight wholesale funding markets, the tri-party general collateral rate (TGCR) and over the counter broad general collateral rate (BGCR).

Gara: The reserve demand curve describes the price at which banks are willing to borrow and lend their reserve balances as a function of aggregate reserves in the system. The interest rate at which reserves are borrowed and lent is the federal funds rate, which is also the policy rate targeted by the
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The reserve demand function measures banks’ demand for liquidity. Estimating the sensitivity of the federal funds rate to shocks to the level of reserves is of paramount importance for the implementation of monetary policy.

time evolution of aggregate reserves normalized by banks’ total assets to control for the growth of the banking industry in our sample. 

Reserves went through a full expansion-contraction cycle from 2010 to late 2019 and expanded again in early 2020, ranging from
8$\%$ (2010 and 2019) to 19$\%$ (2014 and 2021) of banks’ assets. These movements reflect the Federal
Reserve balance-sheet expansions in response to the 2008 and 2020 crises, as well as the interim
normalization period (2015-2019). 
Panel (b) plots the daily average federal funds rate minus the IORB rate to control for changes in the monetary policy stance, which mechanically shift the curve up and down by moving its lower bound. By comparing panels (a) and (b), we can see a negative
correlation between quantities (reserves) and prices (federal funds rates), which suggests that after
removing month-end data from our daily sample, supply shocks tend to dominate demand shocks.
This is confirmed by panel (c), which plots realized rates against realized reserves and can be seen
as an approximate visualization of the reserve demand curve. It shows a clear nonlinear, downward-sloping relationship between prices and quantities that moves outward over time: the curve moved up and to the right after 2014 and further up after March 2020, at the onset of the Covid pandemic

The curve itself, however, also moves horizontally at a low frequency. In the earlier part of
our sample, the rate sensitivity to reserve shocks fades as reserves exceed 12$\%$  of banks’ assets; in
the latter part, instead, it reemerges around 13$\%$ , suggesting a moderate shift to the right. Below
these thresholds, the curve’s slope gets steeper as reserves decrease, consistent with the theory. A
one-percentage-point drop in normalized reserves increases the federal funds-IORB spread by 1.3
basis points (bp) in 2010 and by 1.1 bp in 2019, while having no effect in 2012-2017 and after March
3, 2020. These estimates are robust to controlling for spillovers from the repo and Treasury markets.
Results are qualitatively similar if we normalize reserves by GDP instead of banks’ assets

%\emph{theory reserve demand}
bank demand:  regulatory requirements and liquidity needs, such as daily payments to other institutions.

Banks borrow and lend reserves in the federal funds market, typically overnight, at the federal funds rate. The reserve demand curve describes the price at which banks are willing to trade reserves as a function of the total amount of reserves in the banking system.

Demand curve slope is banks's reserve demand response to shocks:
Low reserves, negative slope, reduce demand as interest rates or shocks...
As reserves keep decreasing, the slope of the curve, i.e., the sensitivity of rates to reserve shocks, becomes increasingly steeper reflecting the
increasing scarcity value of reserves.

High reserves, 0 slope, no response
the demand curve is flat around the interest rate paid by the Federal Reserve on reserve balances (the IORB rate), which is the banks’ opportunity cost of lending in the federal funds market.

b) the daily average federal funds rate minus the IORB rate to control for changes in the monetary policy stance, which mechanically shift the curve up and down by moving its lower bound
c) the relationship between spreads and normalized reserves.

Changes in the IORB rate, by changing the banks’ opportunity cost of lending in the federal funds market, can be thought of as vertical shifts in the reserve demand curve. To control for these demand shifters, which are unrelated to structural changes in banks’ demand for reserves but simply reflect changes in the monetary policy stance, we express the price p in the demand curve (1) as the spread between federal funds rates and the IORB rate.

''' explains ONRRP: The segmentation of the federal funds market between banks and FHLBs suggests that, under our price normalization, the lower bound of the demand function (1), $\ast(p)$ , should range between the
ONRRP-IORB spread and zero.

\emph{Vertical shift}
Changes in the IORB rate, by changing the banks’ opportunity cost of lending in the federal funds market, can be thought of as vertical shifts in the reserve demand curve.
\emph{Horizontal shift}
These structural changes could be interpreted as the horizontal shifts $\ast(q)$ in the demand curve
(1): for every level of the federal funds rate, they imply an increase in the quantity of aggregate
reserves demanded by the banking system. As a result of these shifts, the level of reserves at which
the curve stops being flat and start displaying a negative slope may have moved over time.

 Bertolini, Bertola, Prati () ask how high frequency patterns of FF rate volatility survive Fed's attempt to keep rates close to target and volatility in check. 
 % later both exogenous and intervention- induced shocks to liquidity reserves reflected in banks' trading in interbank markets.

The Fed sets the stance of monetary policy by choosing a target range for the federal funds rate (EFFR), the interest rate at which depository institutions lend funds to each other on an overnight basis. 

The Fed's massive increase in liquidity in response  to the post financial crisis of 2008-2008 (GFC) challenged the bank's ability to control short-term interest rates; the large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) to support the economy. To manage the [MAGNITUDE NUMBERS] liquidity , the Federal Reserve experimented with alternative monetary policies such as quantitative easing (QE) or forward guidance. Asset purchases under QE are  essentially a swap of fixed rate securities US Treasury securities, mortgage-backed securities, and federal agency debt securities  for floating securities, reserves. 
 To regain control over short term interest rates, in 2019 the central initiated  a new regime of ample reserves and a corridor system to manage the Fed Funds rate within FOMC selected target ranges. Using the administered rates, the Fed  manages the federal funds rate (FFR)   to guide the Federal Funds rates between the upper and lower targets for the FFR.  The ceiling of this floor system is the  interest on reserve balances (IOR) that the Fed pays on depositing banks reserves held at the Fed.  The overnight reverse repurchase facility rate (ON RRP) sets a floor under the FFR. The IOR is set equal to the upper range for the fed funds rate, The ON RRP rate is set equal to the lower range for the fed funds rate. Add arbitrage?

The ability to set the IOR and the ONRRP are key for the Fed's implementation of monetary policy. The IOR is the Fed's principal tool for interest rate control.  In 2013, the Federal Reserve introduced the ON RRP facility.the overnight reverse repurchase agreement to set the overnight reverse repo rate (ON RRP), the Fed's supplementary tool for interest rate control.

he New York Fed trading desk allows temporary  adjustments to the U.S. central bank’s level of aggregate reserves by trading securities with banks through repurchase (repos) and reverse repurchase operations (reverse repos).  Repos add reserves [EXPLAIN]. DEFINE sentence  Repo increase reserves, reverse repos decrease reserves.
Federal Reserve OMO or reverse repurchaseS drain  reserves 

%Footnote: Beginning on October 1, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 authorized the Fed to pay interest on reserves the rate IOR on deposits held at the Fed.  Depository institutions - banks, government sponsored entities (GSEs), and now exchanges deposit in their reserve accounts at the Fed. .

%?To ensure an ample supply of bank reserves, the Federal Reserve modified its balance sheet normalization process in January 2019. 
%To implement monetary policy in an ample reserves regime, the Fed manages the federal funds rate EFFR between the FOMC target upper and lower bounds by adjusting the ONRRP and IORB rates. The Federal Reserve also responds to volatility in the federal funds market or the TGCR market through short term repurchase and reverse repurchase operations to  to offset volatility and maintain the FFR within the FOMC target range. 


Banks trade to minimize opportunity cost of holding reserves or illiquidity and receive IOR versus returns from investing in other money market investments.

Our sample of daily overnight policy and money market rates from March 4,2016 through December 29,2022 share characteristics of dispersion, cohesion, and volatility (Figure \ref{fig:ratesample1}).  NYFed data download program published volume-weighted median unsecured EFFR and OBFR rates and the TGCR, BGCR, and SOFR money market rates each day, quoted at an annual rate. Weekends and holidays are excluded from this data set, providing T = 1710  usable observations.   Following Hamilton (1996), I  offer a complete empirical description of the time-series process that generates the daily federal funds ratw and other overnight rates. .

%simultaneously modeling the conditional mean, variance, and overall shape of the probability distribution of daily changes in the federal funds rate.  Spectacular outliers and autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) effects  characterize these data.  Fat tails and the concentration of small changes characterize  federal funds data or EFFR.

Most days the federal funds rate changes very little: more than half the time, the federal funds rate is within 10 basis points of its value on the previous day. But huge changes in the federal funds rate have been observed, such as the the extreme observation being an 800-basis-point rise on March, 2020, the dash for cash event. %These results are then used to understand what happens to the federal funds rate when the Fed makes an open-market purchase.

%Is this true? Is this another hypothesis?  Is this part of the Fed willingness to offset volatility? Rates tend to moving together as the Fed changes its target rates but demonstrate high and variable response to changes in Fed funds rates targets, the administered rates IOR or ONRRP.

\subsection{Rates}
The level of rates  and changes in volatility as measured by the standard deviation is more evident in the latter three years of the sample, 2020, 2021, and 2022 than in the earlier years 2016 and 2017 Table \ref{table:FOMCdailyratestats} ) A second feature of the sample is changes in the volume of transactions, is greater than changes in rates, both in median volumes and and their volatility. Here volatility  as measured by the annual standard deviation of the series.

The unsecured daily median effective Federal Funds rate (EFFR) is... The secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) is a broad measure of the general cost of financing Treasury securities for a broad range of repurchase market participants. SOFR is a measure of the the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities. 

Annual changes in median rates in the early years of the sample, 2016-2019, are not as volatile as the later years 2020-2022. Annual changes in EFFR rates changed some 70 to 87 bp (basis points) in 2017 and 2018, 46 to 52 basis points in 2019. The most volatile changes in the later years are the fall in the EFFR in 2020 of 228 bp and the 158 basis point increase in 2022.								
This difference in rate volatility is borne out by the changes in the standard deviation of the EFFR,3.56				to 14.94 bp in the earlier years, but 24.07 bp in 2020, -55.07 in 2021, and 139.14 in 2022							

older: integrate with above
The EFFR fell 228 basis points from 2019 to 2020.   The secured overnight funding rate (SOFR) fell a similar amount,  230 basis points  in  2021. The EFFR  fell 55 basis points in 2021. Both the  EFFR and SOFR increased 151  and 141 basis points in 2022(\ref{table:FOMCdailyratestats}). The overnight bank funding rate (OBFR), a volume-weighted median of Eurodollar and Fed funds transactions, and the Fed Funds rate (FFR) tend track each other closely.The OBFR provides a more comprehensive gauge of overnight unsecured borrowing costs for U.S -based banks. The OBFR also captures the historical relationship between overnight fed funds and Eurodollars.   

Between 2019 and  2020 the standard deviation of the EFFR increased 24.07 basis points from 33.15 to 57.22 bp. the standard deviation EFFR and SOFR  increased by about the same in 2022, 139 and 138 basis points respectively.   EFFR volatility was low in 2020 and 2021, dropping  57.22 basis points to 2.18. The standard deviation of the EFFR rose 139.1	basis points in 2022  to 141.29 basis points.
To see characteristics of rates in more detail,
 
The level of the secured overnight wholesale funding markets rates,  the tri-party general collateral rate (TGCR), the bilateral general collateral rate (BGCR), and the SOFR cluster near to the unsecured rates EFFR and OBFR.  The TGCR provides a measure of the rate on overnight, tri-party GC repo transactions secured by Treasury securities. In this market counterparties know each other's identity at the time of the trade. This is also the market in which the Fed transactions OMO. NY Bank of Mellon is the settling agent.
The BGCR provides a measure of the rate on overnight Treasury general collateral (GC) repo transactions. It is an over the counter market where participants are searching for a specific security, particular CUSIP.. TGCR and BGCR perform similarly annually and within each year as the unsecured rates, EFFR and OBFR.


%Compared to tri-party repo and FICC DVP, GCF Repo has the smallest volume. GCF Repo rates are not representative of interdealer rates.

\subsection{Times series behavior of rates within different FOMC policy regimes}
We can examine a more detailed look at the time series properties of reference rates and transactions by dividing the sample in subsets that reflect five distinct policy regimes in the data.  

\begin{enumerate}
\item normalcy              3/4/2016-7/31/2019     % 4  859
\item mid cycle adjustment  8/1/2019-10/31/2019 737660  %860 - 923
\item covid                 11/1/2019-3/16/2020   %924  1032
\item zlb                   3/17/2020-3/16/2022     %1032-1516
\item Taming inflation     03/17/2022-12/29/2022 %1517-1741

\subsection{Daily volumes of transactions in the interbank market}
\url{https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates}
 %(\ref{fig:volmeasures}
 The times series behavior of the dollar volume  in overnight rate securities is similar to that of the rates, high levels and volatility in 2020-2022, the tendency to cluster around volumes of the unsecured rates, EFFR and OBFR (Table ~\ref{table:FOMCdailyvolumestats}).
 %Figure \ref{fig:volumesample1}
% (Figure \ref{fig:stackedmedvol}).

The same can be said for the annual changes in volumes traded, small changes in 2016-1019, large changes in 2020-2022. Volumes in EFFR traded  increased by $\$$407 billion in 2020, then dropped off $\$$216 billion in 2021, and fell a further $\$$164 billion in 2022. Traded volumes are volatile during these years, the standard deviation increasing $\$$197,19 in 2020, falling $\$$87.03 billion in 2021, and dropping another $\$$170 billion in 2022.				

older: integrate with above
For the sample period 2016 through 2022, median transactions in unsecured rates were $\$$210 billion (EFFR), $\$$312 billion (OBFR). Volumes in secured rights were much higher $\$$359 (TGCR), $\$$637 (BGCR). It's notable how lower were the volume of transactions in the unsecured rates, the EFFR and OBFR. Trade in SOFR was a small $\$$103 billion where volatility was also the highest, $\$$405 billion. The standard deviations for EFFR, OBFR and  BGCR were around $\$$250 billion,  TGCR a lower $\$$179 billion. The  dollar volume of transactions in the EFFR and SOFR exhibit more volatility than their rates (Table \ref{table:FOMCdailyvolumestats}).

[UPDATE?]
During the earlier years 2016 and 2017,  BGCR volume exceeds TGCR volume until both rates achieve their maximum,  then the reverse as rates and volumes of transactions decline.  During the period of the zero lower bound, there is little trading in any of the overnight rate products. 
The volume of Effective Federal Funds rate (EFFR) transactions rose 407 in 2020 and fell 216 in 2021 and 164 in 2022 \ref{table:FOMCdailyvolumestats}).
Then TCGR and BGCR volumes surge as the FOMC raises the Federal Funds rate in 2022.
(Figure \ref{fig:stackedmedvolumes}). mean, medias, and standard deviations daily volumes ($\$$ billions) characterize their distribution (Table \ref{table:FOMCdailyvolumestats}).
 
The increases in SOFR volumes dwarf the EFFR  increased 068  %268 in 2019 and 878 in 2022. SOFR volumes fell 682 in 2020 and 292 in 2021. Daily SOFR trading volumes, $\$1.1$ trillion
dwarf the Federal funds market, $\$62.5$ billion.

The standard deviation of the volume of EFFR transactions increased 108 $\$62.5$ billion in 2019 and 197 $\$62.5$ billion in 2020 but fell 170$\$62.5$billion in 2022. SOFR 234 $\$62.5$ billion in 2019 and 168$\$62.5$ billion in 2022 but fell 258 $\$62.5$ billion in 2021.
The largest increases in volatility in EFFR occurred in 2019, 108  billion and 197  billion in 2020.
The standard deviation of EFFR fell 38 billion in 2017, 87 billion in 2021, and 170 billion in 2022. Volatility in SOFR fell in  
2017, 9  billion , and 258 billion in 2021.  Major increases occurred in  2019, 234  billion, and  2022,  168	 billion.

Volatility clustering, one of the most important stylized facts in financial markets, refers to the observation that large changes in price tend to be followed by large changes and small changes tend to be followed by small changes. Evidence of clustering of annual volatility across reference rates. Evidence of clusters within these periods (\ref{fig:volmeasures}).  High volatility follows periods of high volatility.Low volatility follows periods of low volatility. 
 From 2017 to 2018, volatility as measured by the annual standard deviation  increased only 8.18 bp, increasing to 29.59 from 21.41 bp  (\ref{table:FOMCratessd}) ).  From 2018 to 2019, volatility of the EFFR fell 3.56 basis points.

\subsection{Weekly rates and reserves}
%(Hypothesis 1 continued 
With weekly data on reserves, I explore the behavior of reference rates and transactions in these instruments joint with the time series characteristics of reserves. Since daily reserve data are available only to Federal Reserve staff, NYFed staff recommended this analysis use  the weekly series of reserves Reserve Balances with Federal Reserve Banks: Week Average (WRESBAL) $\$S$ billions normalized by deposits of commercial banks (DPSACBW027SBOG) $\$S$ billions to control for the growth of the banking industry. Both weekly series ending on Wednesday.

DISCUSS NUMBERS OF NORMALIZED RESERVES
Total reserves in the U. S. banking system now exceed  $\$$3.081237 trillion (Totresns). At the beginning of 2009, reserves were $\$$800 billion, compared to approximately $\$$10 billion pre-crisis. Reserves continued to increase until late 2014. Fed’s quantitative easing programs raised reserves to  a peak of $\$$2.8 trillion in September 2014.  Peak reserves peaked $\$$4.275 at then end of 2021 In November 2022, From late 2017, when the Federal Open Market Committee began implementing its policy of “balance sheet normalization” aggregate reserves began to decline, reaching a low of $\$$1.4 trillion in early September 2019 (Table \ref{table:weeklyreserves}, Figure \ref{fig:weeklyreserves}). 

The sample shows evidence that rates are higher when reserves are low, and the converse when reserves are high or 'ample'. During 2016 and 2017 reserves were $\$$180 to $\$$200 million reaching a low of $\$$160 million on 1/4/2017 (Table ~\ref{table:statsweeklyratesannual}).
During the initial years of the sample from 3/02/2016 until. reserves were around $\$$200 million until 9/28/2016 when reserves fell to $\$$180 million. Then returned to $\$$200 million on 2/15/2017 until  6/24/2018 .
From 7/28/2017 to 6/24/2018, volume weighted median overnight money market rates are higher and normalized reserves are low,  0.19 or $\$$190 million  the week of 7/26/2017 (Figure \ref{figure:vmrates}). All rates reach a maximum at the end of June or first week of July 2018. The EFFR and OBFR reach their maximum value 179.56  and 387.74 basis points respectively during the week 6/24/2018.  The money market rates TGCR, BGCR, and SOFR reach their maxima the following  week 7/1/2018,  Reserves per deposits fell to 0.16 or $\$$160 million on 6/27/2018. All rates then decline, reaching their lowest level 4/5/2020 just as reserves begin to increase to 0.18 or or $\$$180 million . The EFFR reaches a low of 1.74 basis points. Reserves increase from  4/5/2020 to 9/15/2021, 0.24 or $\$$240 million then begin to decline.  From 3/13/2022 to the present, all rates rise steeply with the successive increases in the Fed policy rate response to inflation. The EFFR rises on 3/13/2022 from 1,74 to	27.36 basis points. Reserves decline slightly to 0.17 or $\$$170 million at the end of the sample 12/29/2022 (revise data)
