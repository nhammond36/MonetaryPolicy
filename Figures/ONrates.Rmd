---# Introduction
Level and volatility of overnight policy and wholesale money market rates move closely together but vary dramatically  with external shocks to these markets and different central bank policy regimes.  Goal: to find the willingness of the US central bank  to offset volatility to manage the Federal Funds rates within its target range. in different Federal Reserve policy regimes.

The volume of trade in interbank markets even more volatile than rates

Results section:
Hypotheses 1 Volatility: Changes in the EFFR and OBFR are noticeably related to changes in FOMC target range for the Federal Funds rate (FFR) and administered rates - interest on reserves (IOR) and the overnight reverse repurchase rate (ONRRP).The distributions of secured rates TGCR, BGCR, SOFR share similar characteristics of unsecured rates.  Remarkable high frequency of volatility of policy rates EFFR in ample reserves policy regime even as the FOMC manages the FF rate within target range

Hypotheses 2 Dispersion of rates exists after monetary policy and other shocks, but quick reversion to changes in the federal funds rate (FFR). secured and secured overnight rights indicates transmission versus Duffie Krishnamuthy dispersion hypothesis

4. spreads, indicators of reserves, arbitrage
5. another research question/hypothesie


Hypothesis 3 Fed's preference for offsetting volatility in the Federal Funds market to manage the FFR within its range
 Managing the federal funds rate within its target range under an ample reserves policy regime; Fed tolerance for volatility of unsecured and secured overnight interest rates response to changes in reserves thrugh central bank temporary interventions, changes in target and administered ratesm 
 
Hypothesis 4: Puzzle: The demand for each instrument, price versus volume reveals,large changes in demand but relatively stable rates
A puzzle: price stable, demand fluctuates? Daily rates versus dollar volumes of transactions illustrate demand for these overnight money market instruments. Volumes more volatile than rates

Hypothesis 5 The volatility response of overnight rates to Fed interventions is greater:  the lower reserves, the magnitude of the shock of the monetary policy interventions, the type of  change in policy intervention: the Fed Funds targets, or bounds of the channel for the EFFR rate or the administered rates, the IOR and ONRRP. 
  
Motivation for this work:
- An efficient ample reserves regime minimizes frequency of operations, volatility of interest rates, and balance sheet costs (Schuhlhofer)
-  Bertolini, Bertola, Prati () and Gara () observe the effect of Fed interventions on the volatility in interbank rates

### The time series properties/characteristics of overnight policy, interbank rates, and reserves held at the Federal Reserve
The median effective Federal Funds rate (EFFR) for the sample of daily rates from 3/03/2016 through 12/29 2022 is some 108 basis points. VOlatility as measured by the standard deviation is 98 points.The overnight money market rates TGCR and BGCR share a similar distribution. The unsecured daily median effective Federal Funds rate (EFFR) is...  The secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) is a broad measure of the general cost of financing Treasury securities for a broad range of repurchase market participants. SOFR is a measure of the the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities.TCGR and BCGR. The OBFR is designed to track the EFFR

However, the distributions of daily rates rates and tranasactions transactions, billions of dollars, their medians and standard deviations change dramatically from year to year (Figure \ref{fig:volumesample1}). And within differing FOMC policy regimes.

## Rates
The level of rates  and changes in volatility as measured by the standard deviation is more evident in the latter three years of the sample, 2020, 2021, and 2022 than in the earlier years 2016 and 2017 Table \ref{table:FOMCdailyratestats} ). Annual changes in median rates in the early years of the sample, 2016-2019 (Table \ref{table:FOMCdailyratestats}), are not as volatile as the later years 2020-2022. Annual changes in EFFR rates changed some 70 to 87 bp (basis points) in 2017 and 2018, 46 to 52 basis points in 2019. The most volatile changes in the later years are the fall in the EFFR in 2020 of 228 bp and the 158 basis point increase in 2022

This difference in rate volatility is borne out by the changes in the standard deviation of the EFFR,3.56				to 14.94 bp in the earlier years, but 24.07 bp in 2020, -55.07 in 2021, and 139.14 in 2022		

Changes in the volume of transactions, is greater than changes in rates, both in median volumes and and their volatility. Here volatility  as measured by the annual standard deviation of the series.

## Times series behavior of rates within different FOMC policy regimes
A more detailed look at the time series properties of reference rates and transactions is evident subsets of the sample that reflect five distinct policy regimes in the data:
1. normalcy              3/4/2016-7/31/2019     % 4  859
2. mid cycle adjustment  8/1/2019-10/31/2019 737660  %860 - 923
3. covid                 11/1/2019-3/16/2020   %924  1032
4. Zero lower bound (zlb) 3/17/2020-3/16/2022     %1032-1516
5. Taming inflation     03/17/2022-12/29/2022 %1517-1741

The median EFFR changes from 116 bp during the normalcy period, increases to 212 bp during the adjustment period,then falls precipitously to 127 during covid, reaching a low 7 bp during the zero lower bound. The Federal Funds rate has gone through several increases during the taming of inflation to 233 bp over the period.
Volatility is low under the two earlier regimes 2016 to 2018. 55 bp during covid, 2 during the ZLB, then rising to 127 pb during the taming of inflation.

## Daily volumes of transactions in the interbank market
 The times series behavior of the dollar volume  in overnight rate securities is similar to that of the rates, high levels and volatility in 2020-2022, the tendency to cluster around volumes of the unsecured rates, EFFR and OBFR (Table ~\ref{table:FOMCdailyvolumestats}).
#Figure \ref{fig:volumesample1}
#(Figure \ref{fig:stackedmedvol}).

The same can be said for the annual changes in volumes traded, small changes in 2016-1019, large changes in 2020-2022. Volumes in EFFR traded  increased by $\$$407 billion in 2020, then dropped off $\$$216 billion in 2021, and fell a further $\$$164 billion in 2022. Traded volumes are volatile during these years, the standard deviation increasing $\$$197,19 in 2020, falling $\$$87.03 billion in 2021, and dropping another $\$$170 billion in 2022.	

During the earlier years 2016 and 2017,  BGCR volume exceeds TGCR volume until both rates achieve their maximum,  then the reverse as rates and volumes of transactions decline.  During the period of the zero lower bound, there is little trading in any of the overnight rate products. 
The volume of Effective Federal Funds rate (EFFR) transactions rose 407 in 2020 and fell 216 in 2021 and 164 in 2022 \ref{table:FOMCdailyvolumestats}).
Then TCGR and BGCR volumes surge as the FOMC raises the Federal Funds rate in 2022.
(Figure \ref{fig:stackedmedvolumes}). mean, medias, and standard deviations daily volumes ($\$$ billions) characterize their distribution (Table \ref{table:FOMCdailyvolumestats}).
 
The increases in SOFR volumes dwarf the EFFR  increased 068  %268 in 2019 and 878 in 2022. SOFR volumes fell 682 in 2020 and 292 in 2021. Daily SOFR trading volumes, $\$1.1$ trillion
dwarf the Federal funds market, $\$62.5$ billion.

#older: integrate with above
For the sample period 2016 through 2022, median transactions in unsecured rates were $\$$210 billion (EFFR), $\$$312 billion (OBFR). Volumes in secured rights were much higher $\$$359 (TGCR), $\$$637 (BGCR). It's notable how lower were the volume of transactions in the unsecured rates, the EFFR and OBFR. Trade in SOFR was a small $\$$103 billion where volatility was also the highest, $\$$405 billion. The standard deviations for EFFR, OBFR and  BGCR were around $\$$250 billion,  TGCR a lower $\$$179 billion. The  dollar volume of transactions in the EFFR and SOFR exhibit more volatility than their rates (Table \ref{table:FOMCdailyvolumestats}). 

The standard deviation of the volume of EFFR transactions increased 108 $\$62.5$ billion in 2019 and 197 $\$62.5$ billion in 2020 but fell 170$\$62.5$billion in 2022. SOFR 234 $\$62.5$ billion in 2019 and 168$\$62.5$ billion in 2022 but fell 258 $\$62.5$ billion in 2021.

The largest increases in volatility in EFFR occurred in 2019, 108  billion and 197  billion in 2020.
The standard deviation of EFFR fell 38 billion in 2017, 87 billion in 2021, and 170 billion in 2022. Volatility in SOFR fell in  
2017, 9  billion , and 258 billion in 2021.  Major increases occurred in  2019, 234  billion, and  2022,  168	 billion.

## Clustering, Other measures of volatility
# Add dispersion?
Other measures of volatility %(Figure \ref{fig:volmeasures})
Intraday volatility, standard deviation of EFFR and deviations of the effective federal funds from the target rate
1) simple standard deviation
2) log percent change
\begin{equation*}
vol_1= log(r_{t+1})- log(r_t) 
\end{equation*}
3) standard deviation of log percent change 
$vol_2=standard deviation of vol_1$
4) standard  deviation of log percent change with trailing window of 244 days?   
$vol_3= movstd(vol_2,244) $
%4) deviations of the effective federal funds from the target rate? 
Three measures of rate volatility: percent change, log percent change, rolling standard deviation

Volatility clustering, one of the most important stylized facts in financial markets, refers to the observation that large changes in price tend to be followed by large changes and small changes tend to be followed by small changes. Evidence of clustering of annual volatility across reference rates. Evidence of clusters within these periods (\ref{fig:volmeasures}).  High volatility follows periods of high volatility.Low volatility follows periods of low volatility. 
 From 2017 to 2018, volatility as measured by the annual standard deviation  increased only 8.18 bp, increasing to 29.59 from 21.41 bp  (\ref{table:FOMCratessd}) ).  From 2018 to 2019, volatility of the EFFR fell 3.56 basis points.

## Weekly rates and reserves}
#(Hypothesis 1 continued 
With weekly data on reserves, I explore the behavior of reference rates and transactions in these instruments joint with the time series characteristics of reserves. Since daily reserve data are available only to Federal Reserve staff, NYFed staff recommended this analysis use  the weekly series of reserves Reserve Balances with Federal Reserve Banks: Week Average (WRESBAL) $\$S$ billions normalized by deposits of commercial banks (DPSACBW027SBOG) $\$S$ billions to control for the growth of the banking industry. Both weekly series ending on Wednesday.

DISCUSS NUMBERS OF NORMALIZED RESERVES
Total reserves in the U. S. banking system now exceed  $\$$3.081237 trillion (Totresns). At the beginning of 2009, reserves were $\$$800 billion, compared to approximately $\$$10 billion pre-crisis. Reserves continued to increase until late 2014. Fed’s quantitative easing programs raised reserves to  a peak of $\$$2.8 trillion in September 2014.  Peak reserves peaked $\$$4.275 at then end of 2021 In November 2022, From late 2017, when the Federal Open Market Committee began implementing its policy of “balance sheet normalization” aggregate reserves began to decline, reaching a low of $\$$1.4 trillion in early September 2019 (Table \ref{table:weeklyreserves}, Figure \ref{fig:weeklyreserves}). 

The sample shows evidence that rates are higher when reserves are low, and the converse when reserves are high or 'ample'. During 2016 and 2017 reserves were $\$$180 to $\$$200 million reaching a low of $\$$160 million on 1/4/2017 (Table ~\ref{table:statsweeklyratesannual}).
During the initial years of the sample from 3/02/2016 until. reserves were around $\$$200 million until 9/28/2016 when reserves fell to $\$$180 million. Then returned to $\$$200 million on 2/15/2017 until  6/24/2018 .
From 7/28/2017 to 6/24/2018, volume weighted median overnight money market rates are higher and normalized reserves are low,  0.19 or $\$$190 million  the week of 7/26/2017 (Figure \ref{figure:vmrates}). All rates reach a maximum at the end of June or first week of July 2018. The EFFR and OBFR reach their maximum value 179.56  and 387.74 basis points respectively during the week 6/24/2018.  The money market rates TGCR, BGCR, and SOFR reach their maxima the following  week 7/1/2018,  Reserves per deposits fell to 0.16 or $\$$160 million on 6/27/2018. All rates then decline, reaching their lowest level 4/5/2020 just as reserves begin to increase to 0.18 or or $\$$180 million . The EFFR reaches a low of 1.74 basis points. Reserves increase from  4/5/2020 to 9/15/2021, 0.24 or $\$$240 million then begin to decline.  From 3/13/2022 to the present, all rates rise steeply with the successive increases in the Fed policy rate response to inflation. The EFFR rises on 3/13/2022 from 1,74 to	27.36 basis points. Reserves decline slightly to 0.17 or $\$$170 million at the end of the sample 12/29/2022 (revise data)

###Similar cross section behavior of overnight rates
HYPOTHESIS2: The evidence that daily policy and money market reference rates vary widely with the prevailing monetary policy, a second puzzle is that daily money market rates hover around Fed targets and quickly revert to them in times of shocks.Bertolini et al note the tendency of short term rates to hover around official targets and quickly revert to them in times of shocks.

Both unsecured. EFFR, OBFR, and secured rates, TGCR, BGCR, and SOHR, median rates are at most 15 basis points of each other at any point during the sample period 2016-2022. For example, 10 bp in 2016, 15 bp in  2017 5 bp in  2018, 1 bp in 2019 2 bp in 2020, 3 bp in  2021, 8 bp in 2022.  But the disperions of the EFFR and SOFR rate between the  25th and 75th percentiles  are large as 250 basis points (Figure \ref{fig:dispersionEFFR} anc Figure \ref{fig:dispersionSOFR}). In contrast, the dispersion among volumes traded (the bottom plot) is relatively small except for SOFR (Figure). The New York Fed only provides quintiles for the EFFR and SOFR. The sample standard deviations of the EFFR and SOFR (Figure) vary about 50 basis points between the 25th and 75th percentiles.

From the point of view of finance, overnight federal funds represent the shortest-term security that is actively traded and thus form the base of any term structure relation. Indeed, recent papers by Balduzzi, Bertola, and Foresi (1993), Roberds, Runkle, and Whiteman (1994), and Rudebusch (1994) suggest that several well-known puzzles in the term structure of interest rates can be resolved by tracking these relations back to daily changes in the federal funds rate.

The argument that the FFR rollows a random walk argument rests on the idea that  Federal Funds  are perfect substitutes on any business day for  satisfying banks' liquidity needs, $i_t = E_t i_{t+1}$.  A natural hypothesis would be that the federal funds rate on day t  should be equal to the rate that banks' funds traders expect to hold the following day. Otherwise, profits for trading.  If $i_t > E_t i_{t+}$, it would pay a bank to lend one more dollar on today's federal funds market. That leaves the bank the possibilities of borrow one more dollar at date t + 1 to fulfill its desired level at an expected lower cost $i_{t+}$, or it leaves the bank with one less dollar of excess reserves available for lending tomorrow, an expected opportunity cost $i_{t+}$ of  forgone revenue. In either case, the bank would profit by lending today. 

##Mean reversion tests:
  J.M. Poterba and LH. Summers, Mean reversion in stock prices
We find consistent evidence that stock returns are positively
serially correlated over short horizons, and negatively autocorrelated over long horizons. The point estimates suggest that the transitory components in stock prices have a standard deviation of between 15 and 25 percent and account for more than half of the variance in monthly returns. 

The last part of the paper discusses two possible explanations for mean reversion: time varying required returns, and slowly—decaying "price fads" that cause stock prices to deviate from fundamental values for periods of several years  

If divergences between market and fundamental values exist, but beyond some limit are eliminated by speculative forces, then stock prices will exhibit mean reversion. Returns must be negatively
serially correlated at some frequency if "erroneous" market moves are eventually corrected.2

Section 1 begins by evaluating alternative statistical procedures for testing for transitory components in stock prices. We find that variance ratio tests of the type used by Fama and French
(1986a) and Lo and MacKinlay (1987) come close to being the most powerful tests of the null hypothesis of market efficiency cum constant required returns against plausible alternative hypotheses such as the "fads" model suggested by Shiller (1984) and Summers (1986). 

Fama and French (1986a) and Lo and MacKinlay (1987) compare the relative variability of return(1987) use over different horizons usimg variance ratio test. Fama and French use regressions tests to study serial correlation in many-period returns  Regress R^k(t), the demeaned k period return,  on R^k(t-k).  

The variance ratio test exploits the fact that if the logarithm of the cumulated dividends, follows a random walk then the return variance should be proportional to the return horizon.3 

A third method of detecting mean reversion involves computing a likelihood ratio test of the null hypothesis of serial independence against a particular alternative

Use excess or real returns.  FF used nominal. We consider nominal returns on these indices, excess
returns with the risk-free rate measured as the Treasury bill yield, as well as real returns measured using the CPI inflation rate.. Returns at long horizons exhibit negative serial correlation as reflected in vairance ration < 1

where Rt = Rt., Rt denoting the total return in month t.4 This statistic

converges to unity if returns are uncorrelated through time. If some of the
price variation is due to transitory factors, this will generate negative autocorrelations
at some lags and yield a variance ratio below one.
The variance ratio is closely related to earlier tests based on estimated
autocorrelations. Cochrane (1986) shows that the ratio of the k—month return
variance to k times the one-month return variance is approximately equal to a
linear combination of sample autocorrelations. Using his results, it is
straightforward to show that (1) can be approximated by:

Section 3 uses our variance ratio estimates to gauge the substantive significance of transitory components in stock prices. For the United States we find that the standard deviation of the transitory price component varies between 15 and 25 percent of value, depending on what assumption we make about its persistence.
The point estimates imply that transitory components account for more than half of the variance in monthly returns
    pp30-31
Sommers Poterba study the mean-reverting behavior of individual corporate securities in the U.S. The results consistently
suggest the presence of transitory components in stock prices, with returns showing positive autocorrelation over short periods but negative autocorrelation over longer periods.
Section 4 uses our variance-ratio

If market and fundamental values diverge, but beyond some range the differences are eliminated by speculative forces, then stock prices will revert to their mean. Returns must be negatively serially correlated at some frequency if 'erroneous' market moves are eventually corrected. 
The variance-ratio test exploits the fact that if the logarithm of the stock price, including cumulated dividends, follows a random walk, the return variance should be proportional to the return horizon.
We study the variability of returns at different horizons, in relation to the variation over a one-year period. For monthly returns, the variance-ratio statistic is therefore
where

VR(k) = k l2 ,
k-1
Rkt = "£.. ... R t-i•
i=O
(1)
R1 denoting the total return in month t. This statistic converges to unity if returns are uncorrelated through time. If some of the price variation is due to transitory factors, however, autocorrelations at some lags will be negative and
the variance ratio will fall below one. 

The statistics reported below are corrected for small-sample bias by dividing by E[VR(k)].
The variance ratio is closely related to earlier tests based on estimated autocorrelations. Using Cochrane's (1988) result that the ratio of the k-month return variance to k times the one-month return variance is approximately equal to a linear combination of sample autocorrelations, (1) can be written
VR ( k) == 1 + 2 L --1 Pj- 2 L --1 Pj• k-l(k- ") ll (12- ")
j=l k j=l 12
(2)
The variance ratio places increasing positive weight on autocorrelations up to
and including lag 11, with declining positive weight thereafter. Our variance
ratios for k-period annual returns place declining weight on all autocorrelations
up to order k.
A second test for mean reversion, used by Fama and French (1988b),
regresses multiperiod returns on lagged multiperiod returns. If R~ denotes the de-meaned k-period return, the regression coefficient is
(3)
This statistic applies negative weight to autocorrelations up to order 2kj3,followed by increasing positive weight up to lag k, followed by decaying positive weights.7
Fama and French (1988b) report regression tests because they reject the null hypothesis of serially independent returns more strongly than the variance-ratio test

Hamilton (1996) and others have concluded that the martingale hypothesis is clearly inconsistent with observed daily changes in the federal funds rate. (Bertolini,Bertola, Prati ,) also conclude  the FFR does not follow a martingale process due to frictions such as  transacions costs, interbank credit limits, overdraft penalties, obstacles to intra-period arbitrage.


To gain insight into the idea that FFR rates on any day are subsitutes, I repeated Fama French regressions of the five overnight rates on their lqyw,  for  1, 2, 3, 5, 7, up to 10 days of daily rate data;
\begin{equation*}
r_T = a + b_t r_(t-k)}
\end{equation*}

%ADD t,se F stats
The coefficientss of the EFFR on prior days are close to 1, different from other evidence the Fed Funds rate is not a martingale (Hamilton, 1996 and others).  The regression coefficient of the EFFR on the prior day is 1.02, 1.06 two days, 1.07 three days, and  1.12 five days (Table ~\ref{table:dailyratesvar}).  This suggests the Federal Funds rate is a martingale in the high frequency data, over one or two trading days. With 1710 observations, standard errors are small. Intercepts $gamma_0$, however,  are non zero.

That other rates are substitutes for the FFR for bank liquidity needs is low on a daily basis but the adjustment to the EFFR increases at longer lags. All rates OBFR, TGCR, BGCR, SOFR load significantly on the prior lag of the EFFR. For a one day lag, the OBFR coefficient on the EFFR is 0.4, TGCR 0.53, BGCR 0.54 but 0.85 on SOFR. Loadings on longer lags are higher, on five days the OBFR reaching 0.78, 0.81 TGCR, 0.84 BCGR, and 1.06  SOFR.%(Table \ref{table:dailyratesvar})/ This high frequency evidenve that other rates adjust within days to settings of the FFR.

Duffie and Alonso provide evidence that there exists significant dispersion of the awcuews nibwy market rates from the policy rate that suggest problems for transmission of FONC to the broader economy.


Gara Afonso, Kyungmin Kim, Antoine Martin, Ed Nosal, Simon Potter, and Sam Schulhofer-Wohl propose  dispersion index  $D_t$ of the daily EFFR from upper and lower target rates.


The daily value of $D_t$ ,the deviations between the value weighted daily fed funds rate and weighted fed funds rate, the actual policy target (the EFFR, the effective fed funds rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) FOMC  (Figure), During  2016-2022 managing the policy rate within its target range may have become more challenging during stress in repo markets in 2019 (\ref{fig:dispersionEffrGara}). ADD OBSERVATIONS

The Federal Reserve's “balance-sheet normalization,” which reduced aggregate reserves between 2017
and September 2019, increased repo rate distortions, the severity of rate spikes, and intraday payment
timing stresses, culminating with a significant disruption in Treasury repo markets in mid-September
2019.
  
After the introduction of IOER in 2008, the target federal funds rate is set at
the middle of the Fed’s target range for FFER. Even during the challenging episodes in September16-18, 2019 and March 16-19, 2020, the Fed maintained the EFFR at the upper target:

### Review monetary policy regimes, introduce epochs
Fed Ample Reserves policy
The QE1, QE2, and QE3 asset purchases challenged changed the bank’s ability to control short-term interest
rates. Asset purchases under QE resulted in central banks changing their overall frameworks for controlling
short-term interest rates:
In 2019, the FOMC abandoned it’s regime of active management of scarce reserves and other shortterm
interest rates and adopted a policy of an ample supply of reserves. Before the crisis, monetary policy
adjusted the scarcity value of a limited supply of central bank deposits (reserves).
A “floor” system manages the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates in an ample
reserves regime. The FOMC selects a target range for the federal funds rate. To keep the Federal funds
within its target range, the upper and lower targets set by the Federal Open Market Committe (FOMC), 1)

4.3 How does the Fed manage interest rates in an an ample reserves regime,
the floor system
Control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates in an ample reserves regime is a
version of a “floor” system where the FOMC set the administered rates, interest on reserve balances (IOR)
on deposits held at the bank, and the overnight reverse repurchase facility (ON RRP) to influence the federal
funds rate.
The New York Fed conducts repo and reverse repo operations each day as a means to help keep
the federal funds rate in the target range set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Operation
results include all repo and reverse repo operations conducted, including small value exercises. https:

Repo markets are essential for the U.S. financing of it’s debt. Around $2 trillion to $4 trillion of
debt are financed here each day. The cash that institutions receive goes toward funding daily operations.
To support its policy objectives, the FOMC has established repo and reverse repo facilities. The
Overnight Reverse Repo Facility (ON RRP) helps provide a floor under overnight interest rates by acting as
an alternative investment for a broad base of money market investors when rates fall below the interest on
reserve balances (IORB) rate. The Standing Repo Facility (SRF) serves as a backstop to dampen upward
interest rate pressures that can occasionally emerge in overnight U.S. dollar funding markets and spillover
into the fed funds market. The Desk generally conducts both the ON RRP and SRF operations each business
day.
Participants include financial firms with large pools of cash to earn interest. Repo markets also
allow financial institutions to borrow cheaply to fund short-term needs. Other non bank institutions who
cannot hold reserves at the Fed include, hedge funds, money market funds, and insurance companies.

4.4 The floor system of managing the Fed funds rate under the Ample Reserves
regime
excess liquidity and control of interest rates Asset purchases under QE resulted in central banks changing their
overall frameworks for controlling short-term interest rates: Pre-crisis, these frameworks were typically based
on adjusting the scarcity value of a limited supply of central bank deposits (reserves), but the substantial
increase in liquidity resulting from asset purchases in response to the crisis made other techniques necessary.
The administered rates, the IOR and the ON RPP, (and now the repo facility) along with an ample
supply of reserves created a corridor system for managing the Fed Funds rate. The effectiveness of monetary
policy to transmit the desired stance of monetary policy to financial markets and the real economy economy
depends on efficient transmission of rate changes to other short rates in wholesale and consumer funding
market. Duffie, Krishnamurthi identify dispersion across money market interest rates as a primary indicator
of the level of efficiency in how other key short-term interest rates reflect Fed policy changes. This paper
examines the dispersion and volatility of short term rates.
# --------------------------------------------



The Fed sets the stance of monetary policy by choosing a target range for the Federal Funds rate (FFR), the interest rate at
which depository institutions or ”banks” lend funds to each other on an overnight basis. To implement monetary policy in an ample reserves regime, the Fed adjusts administrative rates ro manages the FFR between the FOMC target upper and lower bounds.

Administered rates are standing interest rates the Fed
sets to guide the policy rate, the Federal Funds rates. The interest on reserves rate (IOR or IORB) is the
Fed’s principal tool for interest rate control.The IOR rate is the interest rate that banks earn from the Fed on the funds they deposit in their reserve accounts.The IOR. On October 1, 2008, Congress gave the Fed this new tool to help control the fed funds rate,
The overnight reverse repo rate (ONRRP) facility offering rate is the Fed’s supplementary tool for interest rate control. In 2013, the Federal Reserve introduced the ONRRP facility to set a floor under the EFFR.

The ability to set the IOR and the ONRRP are key
for the Fed’s implementation of monetary policy.

No bank would lend at rates on overnight cash lower than the IOR, the rate they can receive from the Fed. Thus Banks have little or no incentive to lend their reserves to other banks at rates lower than the IOR rate. In this sense, the IOR rate is in effect a reservation rate for banks’ intermediation activities,
No bank should be borrow at a higher rate than the ONRRP. Banks and non-bank financial institutions should be unwilling to invest funds in private markets below the ONRRP.
No bank should lend at a lower rate than the ONRPP. Competition among borrowers should drive rates to the discount window (DW) rate. 
Thus, the IOR is a ceiling on managing the EFFR, the ONRRP rate a floor.

The Federal Reserve also responds to volatility in the federal funds market by adjusting the reserve supply to keep the federal funds rate within its target range  by buying or selling assets from banks. These temoporary adjustments to reserves to offset volatility in the Fed Funds rate When the Federal Reserve changes the level of aggregate reserves by trading securities with banks, these Federal Reserve purchases or sales of assets from banks change the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet.
In a repo transaction, the Federal Reserve purchases securities from banks. It adds assets to its balance sheet and issues reserves by crediting the Federal Reserve accounts of the selling banks. Fed is lender?
When the Federal Reserve sells securities to banks in reverse repo transaction, aggregate reserves decline. (Fed repo as borrower)?

DUPLICATE or ADDITION?:
Each repo transaction is economically similar to a loan collateralized by securities, and temporarily increases the supply of reserve balances in the banking system.
Conversely, in a reverse repo transaction, the Desk sells securities to a counterparty subject to an
agreement to repurchase the securities at a later date. Reverse repo transactions temporarily reduce the
supply of reserve balances in the banking system.
These open market operations support effective monetary policy implementation and smooth market
functioning by helping maintain the federal funds (fed funds) rate within the FOMC’s target range.

These temporary interventions  happened in September 2019 and March 2020. These responses are quick and are put in place within a matter of days. In September 2019, for example, the federal funds rate spiked up on the 16th and 17th; starting on the 18th, the Federal Reserve expanded the reserve supply by providing cash in the repo market, and rates returned to their prior levels
(Afonso et al. (2020a)).  

Because the March 2020 covid crisis news also caused severe illiquidity in the secondary market for Treasury securities, the Fed purchased enormous quantities of Treasuries and Agencies, expanding the total supply of reserves from mid-March by about $1 trillion in just three weeks. 

DUFFIE As a by-product of this
huge asset purchase program, the total reserve balances of our sample of the ten largest repo-active BHCs
increased dramatically. With this and other aggressive actions by the Fed to restore market liquidity, dealer
banks provided reserves much more elastically into the repo market and the spread between SOFR and IOR
essentially disappeared from April ? 

2020 to December 29, the end of my sample period.
liquidity after the Fed’s post GFC attempt to support the economy through large-scale asset purchases
(LSAPs), the Federal Reserve experimented with alternative monetary policies such as quantitative easing
(QE) or forward guidance. Asset purchases under QE are essentially a swap of fixed rate securities US
Treasury securities, mortgage-backed securities, and federal agency debt securities for floating securities,
reserves. This increase in liquidity challenged the bank’s ability to control short-term interest rates. resulted in central banks to institute a new regime of ample reserves and a corridor system to manage its policy rate within FOMC selected target ranges, this large increase in liquidity,


Total reserves in the U. S. banking system now exceed $3.081237 trillion (Totresns). At the beginning
of 2009, reserves were $800 billion, compared to approximately $10 billion pre-crisis. Reserves continued
to increase until late 2014. Fed’s quantitative easing programs raised reserves to a peak of $2.8 trillion in
September 2014. Peak reserves peaked $4.275 at then end of 2021 In November 2022, From late 2017,
when the Federal Open Market Committee began implementing its policy of “balance sheet normalization”
aggregate reserves began to decline, reaching a low of $1.4 trillion in early September 2019.

The level of reserves can also change when institutions that have non-reserve Federal Reserve accounts transact with private banks. When these transfers occur, reserves are either created or destroyed outside the Federal Reserve’s control.


\begin(comment)
No bank should be borrow at a higher rate, Banks and non-bank financial institutions should be
unwilling to invest funds in private markets below the ONRPP.
No bank should lend at a lower rate than the ONRPP. and competition among borrowers should
drive rates to the discount window (DW) rate.
Thus, the IOR is a ceiling on managing the EFFR, the ONRPP a floor. INSERT FIGURE

hold balances in an account at the Fed that earns IOR.
Banks’ choice of whether to hold cash in reserve accounts at the Fed and earn the IOR rate or invest
their cash in another money market instrument, such as Treasury bills, depend on their liquidity needs and
the opportunity cost of holding reserves, relative returns available on alternative investments.
Banks can choose to invest overnight cash at the Fed and earning IOR; loaning the cash to another
bank and earning the negotiated (market) FFR; or investing the cash in another money market alternative,
such as by purchasing a Treasury bill or commercial paper.
No bank would accept a rate on overnight cash lower than the IOR. Banks should not accept an
interest rate below what they can receive from the Fed. Thus Banks have little or no incentive to lend their
reserves to other banks at rates lower than the IOR rate. In this sense, the IOR rate is in effect a reservation
rate for banks’ intermediation activities,
As long as the supply of reserves remains ample, cash lenders should compete with each other so
that trading in the federal funds market occurs at rates that are never too far above the IOR rate. As a
result, in an ample-reserves regime, the EFFR is expected to trade near the IOR rate.

The COVID-19 Pandemic Caused Market Disruptions across Sovereign Bond Markets
At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in late February 2020, and in response to the economic repercussions of impending lockdown measures, investors began to demand higher-quality, safe assets. In particular, they shifted their portfolios toward sovereign bonds, and the resulting buying pressure drove sovereign yields to decline broadly. As the crisis intensified in March 2020, however, investors’ demand for cash surged, leading to selling pressure on sovereign bonds and therefore increases in their yields. This down-and-up pattern in yields is illustrated for ten-year U.S., German, U.K., and Japanese bonds in the chart below.

High frequency FF rate volatility patterns intriguing versus Fed effort to target rates
This section examines how volatility of Fed policy and key short rates in the economy respond to
FOMC targets for the federal funds rate, changes in their administered rates – interest on reserves (IOR) and
overnight reverse repurchase rate (ONRPP), and interventions in repo markets to maintain the Fed Funds
rate within its target range.

JULIEN GUYON and JORDAN LEKEUFACK VOLATILITY IS (MOSTLY) PATH-DEPENDENT
Bloomberg L.P., Quantitative Research Ecole des Ponts ParisTech, CERMICS
volatility is mostly path-dependent: up to 90 percent of the variance of the implied volatility of equity indexes explained endogenously by past index returns, and up to 65 percent for (noisy estimates of) future daily realized volatility. The path-dependency that we uncover is remarkably simple: a linear
combination of a weighted sum of past daily returns and the square root of a weighted sum of past daily squared returns with different time-shifted power-law weights capturing both short and long memory. 

This simple model, which is homogeneous in volatility, is shown to consistently outperform existing models across equity indexes and train/test sets for both implied and realized volatility. It suggests a simple continuoustime path-dependent volatility (PDV) model that may be fed historical or risk-neutral parameters. The
weights can be approximated by superpositions of exponential kernels to produce Markovian models. In particular, we propose a 4-factor Markovian PDV model which captures all the important stylized facts of volatility, produces very realistic price and (rough-like) volatility paths, and jointly fits SPX and VIX smiles
remarkably well. We thus show that a continuous-time Markovian parametric stochastic volatility (actually,PDV) model can practically solve the joint SPX/VIX smile calibration problem.


It is crucial for the pricing, hedging, and risk-management of portfolios of derivatives to understand and correctly capture the joint dynamics of the underlying assets and their implied volatilities. For example pricing and hedging portfolios of S&P 500 (SPX) derivatives requires to precisely understand the joint
dynamics of the SPX and VIX indices. It is also very useful to build accurate predictors of future realized volatility


We thus aim to empirically explain volatility as an endogenous factor as best as we can. Our empirical study covers (a) learning implied volatility from past asset returns (e.g., learn the VIX from the SPX path), and (b) learning future realized volatility from past asset returns. We prove that volatility is mostly path-dependent. A surprisingly simple linear PDV model explains up to 90 percent of the variance of the implied volatility (depending on the equity index), and up to 65 percent of the variance of the (more noisy) future daily realized volatility, even on our very challenging test set (2019–2022). This proves that
volatility is mostly endogenous. 

The explicit path-dependency that we uncover is remarkably simple: a linear combination of a weighted sum R1 of past daily returns and the square root of a weighted sum R2 of past daily squared returns with different time-shifted power-law (TSPL) weights.

Guyon model where historical volatility Σt.
(3.12) Volatility  $V= \beta_0 + \beta_1 R_{1,t} + \beta_2\epsions_t$
where volatilityt denotes either some implied volatility (e.g., the VIX) observed at t, or some future realized volatility right after t (e.g., realized over day t + 1). The model states that the volatility—not its square, the variance—is simply an affine combination of the trend feature $R_{1,t}$ and the historical volatility $\epsions_t$.
Simple models Volatilityt denotes either some implied volatility (e.g., the VIX) observed at t, or some future realized volatility right after t (e.g., realized over day t + 1). Trend features are features that capture a recent trend in the asset price in order to learn the leverage effect, i.e., the fact that volatility
tends to rise when asset prices fall. The most important example of a trend feature is a weighted sum of past daily returns

X
K1(tti)rti
where

(3.2)rti = StiSti1Sti1
denotes the daily return between day ti−1 and day ti , and K1 : R￿0 → R￿0 is a convolution kernel that
puts more or less weight on past daily returns based on the lag t − ti , i.e., on how far in the past the daily
return was observed. The kernel K1 typically decreases towards zero: the impact of a given daily return
fades away over time. Other examples o trend features include the weighted sum of negative parts of past
daily returns (3.3) Nt := X ti￿t KN (t − ti)r − ti
Activity features or volatility features are features that capture recent activity (volatility) in the
asset price, regardless of its trend, in order to learn volatility clustering, i.e., the fact that periods of large
volatility tend to be followed by periods of large volatility, and periods of small volatility tend to be followed
by periods of small volatility. Volatility clustering also materializes in the fact that implied volatility tends
to be larger when historical volatility is larger. The most important example of a volatility feature is a
weighted sum of past squared daily returns

bidimensional kernel KQ2 are one order of magnitude smaller than the diagonal entries. The corresponding
diagonal QARCH model reads (M1)
